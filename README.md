## üöÄ Solution

SmartPrice solves this by using **machine learning** to:
- Predict how many items will sell at different prices
- Simulate profit across price ranges
- Find the **sweet spot** ‚Äî the price that gives the **maximum profit**
- Show the result in a visual + downloadable format via Streamlit
